## Comments based on student feedback

**Last updated June 2021**

I've seen some comments from learners that this course left out some things or didn't go as deep as they'd like, and some questions about if the course was constrained to fit approximately 2 hours. The answer is yes. The original version of this course was longer and covered more material, but Pluralsight requested the new version be slimmed down. It's a lot to cover so I had to leave some things out and refer to other courses are to the code samples.

A few folks have noted that, when trying to follow along step-by-step, I skip a few steps (like introducing the Rater base class). I'm sorry but this was necessary for time constraint purposes. If you're looking for it, [the initial Rater class is here](https://github.com/ardalis/SolidSample/blob/OCP-reflection/ArdalisRating/Rater.cs).

The final version of the project after all principles are applied is here:

- [SOLID Principles of OO Design](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/principles-oo-design) - The original 4 hour course with different samples and coverage of the DRY principle as well
- [Refactoring Fundamentals](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/refactoring-fundamentals) - An 8 hour more in depth version of the above Refactoring course. The new version was slimmed down just like this new SOLID course was.
